  Q: "My model gets 99% accuracy on the fastball no-fastbball prediction problem."
  A: "You are probably \"cheating\" by allowing some leakage from your target variable into your predictor variables."

  Q: "In `sklearn.train_test_split` does a value of test_size=.25 mean that 25% of the data will be reserved for training or for testing?"
  A: "As long as the return arguments are in the order `x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test` then the test_size argument controls the size of the samples in the test_set (`x_test` and `y_test`). But as with all data transformations you should verify that your intended transformation has been accomplished. In this case this means verifying the `.shape` of the 4 returned variables after having run `train_test_split()`."
